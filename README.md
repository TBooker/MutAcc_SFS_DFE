## Mutation accumulation versus the SFS

In this repository, we have the scripts and analysis files for our project on estiamting the parameters of the DFE.

We built an organism **in silico**. We then performed a mutation accumulation experiment upon the organism and generated fitness data. We also evolved a large panmictic population to coalesence and examined SNP frequencies.
